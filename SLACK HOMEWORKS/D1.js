1)
Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are same, then returns triple their sum.

2)
Write a JavaScript program to check two given numbers and return true if one of the number is 50 or if their sum is 50.

3)
Write a JavaScript program to remove a character at the specified position of a given string and return the new string.

4)
 Write a JavaScript program to find the largest of three given integers.

5)
Write a JavaScript program to check whether two numbers are in range 40..60 or in the range 70..100 inclusive.

6) 

Write a JavaScript program to create a new string of specified copies (positive number) of a given string.

7)
Write a JavaScript program to display the city name if the string begins with "Los" or "New" otherwise return blank.

8)
Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of three elements of a given array of integers of length 3.

9)
Write a JavaScript program to test whether an array of integers of length 2 contains 1 or a 3. 

10)

Write a JavaScript program to test whether an array of integers of length 2 does not contain 1 or a 3

11)

Write a JavaScript to find the longest string from a given array of strings.

12)

Write a JavaScript program to find the types of a given angle.

Types of angles:
    Acute angle: An angle between 0 and 90 degrees.
    Right angle: An 90 degree angle.
    btuse angle: An angle between 90 and 180 degrees.
    Straight angle: A 180 degree angle.

13)

Write a JavaScript program to find the index of the greatest element of a given array of integers

14)

Write a JavaScript program to get the largest even number from an array of integers.

15)

Write a JavaScript program to check two given numbers and return true if one of the number is 50 or if their sum is 50.

16)

Write a JavaScript program to check from two given integers, whether one is positive and another one is negative.

17)

Write a JavaScript program to create new string with first 3 characters are in lower case and the others in upper case. If the string length is less than 3 convert all the characters in upper case. 

18)

Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of the two given integers, If the sum is in the range 50..80 return 65 other wise return 80.

19)

Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, just pass the number's digits straight through.
Examples
28's factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28.
In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
30's factors are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".

20)
Convert a phrase to its acronym, like Portable Network Graphics to its acronym (PNG).
